## Motivation
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/BsZyNmH/Normal-Mode.png" alt="Logo" border="0">
    <br>A Customised version of window's notepad with additional features.
</p>

The primary motivation for building a custom notepad was mainly due to the lack of features on the default one.<br>
The only use of the default notepad is to take down quick notes. There are no other formating features. <br>
It is outdated and hence I set out to build my own custom version of the notepad with loaded features, including the dark mode.

## Installation

Prerequisite : **Python 3**.
